# DataMiningAssignment 2

## Assignment 1: automl
Was facing issue in uploading data in jadbio so explored DataRobot instead.
DataRobot is a leading machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) platform that empowers organizations to build, deploy, and manage predictive models and machine learning solutions efficiently. It is designed to streamline the end-to-end process of developing machine learning models, making data science more accessible to a broader range of users, including data scientists, analysts, and business professionals.

I have recorded the video and uploaded in drive due to its huge size.

Please find the link to the video above.

## Assignment 2: pycaret

PyCaret is a Python library that simplifies various facets of data science and machine learning projects. It serves as a valuable toolkit, streamlining and automating complex tasks typically encountered when working with data.

I have performed Binary Classification, Multiclass classification, regression, clustering, anomaly detection, association rules mining and time series forecasting uwith and without exogenous variables. I have used pycaret to perform the given tasks. I uploaded the copies of google colab notebooks to this folder.

### Gradio examples
Gradio serves as a valuable tool for data scientists and developers, facilitating the creation of interactive web interfaces for machine learning models. It empowers users to showcase and utilize their models effectively, bridging the gap between machine learning and end-users.

I have tried two examples using Gradio. Please find the video in the following link.
